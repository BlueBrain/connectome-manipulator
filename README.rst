Introduction
------------

An important way to study cortical function *in silico* lies in manipulations that are impossible to perform *in vivo* and *in vitro*. The purpose of the *Connectome-Manipulator* is to provide a general framework to apply and study various types of structural manipulations of a circuit connectome. The framework allows for rapid connectome manipulations of biophysically detailed network models in `SONATA <https://github.com/AllenInstitute/sonata/blob/master/docs/SONATA_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md>`_ format, the standard for large-scale network models. Manipulations can be targeted to entire models, specific sub-networks, or even single neurons, ranging from insertion or removal of specific motifs to complete rewiring based on stochastic connectivity models at various levels of complexity.
Important use cases include wiring a connectome from scratch in a biologically realistic way based on given features of connectivity, rewiring an existing connectome while preserving certain aspects of connectivity, and transplanting specific connectivity characteristics from one connectome to another. The resulting connectomes can be readily simulated using any simulator supporting SONATA, allowing systematic and reproducible characterization of causal effects of manipulations on network activity.

Install
-------

From `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/connectome-manipulator>`_
(recommended):

::

   pip install connectome-manipulator

Alternatively, from
`GitHub <https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator>`_:

::

   git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator.git
   cd connectome-manipulator
   pip install .

All dependencies declared in ``setup.py`` and are available from PyPI, including one optional dependency, ``mpi4py`` (v3.1.4), which is required for parallel processing, i.e., to run ``parallel-manipulator``. Another optional dependency, ``parquet-converters`` (v0.8.0 or higher), required for converting .parquet output files to SONATA must be installed separately, see instructions under https://github.com/BlueBrain/parquet-converters.

Recommended Python version: v3.10.8

Framework overview
------------------

Main components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Connectome-Manipulator* framework is illustrated in Figure 1 and
consists of the following main components:

-  | **Connectome manipulator**
   | As specified in the config, applies one or a sequence of manipulations to a given SONATA connectome, and writes the manipulated connectome to a new SONATA edges file. All manipulations are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.
   | Details can be found in the corresponding README file in the repository: `connectome_manipulation/README.md <https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator/blob/main/connectome_manipulator/connectome_manipulation/README.md>`_

-  | **Model building**
   | As specified in the config, builds a model from a given connectome and writes the model to a file to be loaded and used by specific manipulations requiring a model (e.g., model-based rewiring based on connection probability model). All models are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.
   | Details can be found in the corresponding README file in the repository: `model_building/README.md <https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator/blob/main/connectome_manipulator/model_building/README.md>`_

      Notes:

      -  Some models may not even require a connectome as input.
      -  Some models may depend on other models as input for model
         building.

-  | **Structural comparator**
   | As specified in the config, performs a structural comparison of the original and manipulated connectomes. Different structural parameters to compare (connection probability, synapses per connection, ...) are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.
   | Details can be found in the corresponding README file in the repository: `connectome_comparison/README.md <https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator/blob/main/connectome_manipulator/connectome_comparison/README.md>`_

ℹ️ More details can be also found in the accompanying publication (esp.
*Supplementary tables*), see `Citation`_.

Operation principle of the "connectome manipulator"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As illustrated in Figure 2, the synapses of the connectome (SONATA edges) are divided into k splits targeting disjoint sets of N post-synaptic neurons (SONATA nodes), which reduces the memory consumption and facilitates parallelization on multiple computation nodes. Each split is an edge table loaded as Pandas dataframe and comprising a list of synapses together with all synapse properties, an example is shown in Figure 3. The manipulations are then applied separately to each edge table in sequence (or alternatively, in parallel), resulting in manipulated edge tables which are then written to separate .parquet files. In the end, all .parquet files are merged into one manipulated SONATA connectome file using ``parquet-converters``.

..

   Notes:

   -  Manipulations can only be applied to a single SONATA edges population at a time.
   -  The synapses in each loaded edge table are assumed to be sorted by post-synaptic neuron ID. Likewise, the manipulated edges tables are to be returned with synapses sorted by post-synaptic neuron ID.
   -  Optionally, processing can be resumed from an earlier (incomplete) run, by re-using all .parquet files that already exist instead of re-computing them.
   -  By default, all .parquet files will be deleted after successfull completion, i.e., after the manipulated SONATA connectome file has been generated. Optionally, these temporary .parquet files can be kept as well.

Just running serially you can do something like this:

::

   connectome-manipulator -v manipulate-connectome wiring_config.json \
       --output-dir PATH_TO_OUTPUT --profile --convert-to-sonata --splits 1

Running splits in parallel (with Dask) you can use the ``parallel-manipulator`` executable that will set up Dask automatically (and switch the ``--parallel`` flag by default to ``True``, too):

::

   srun --nodes 10 --tasks-per-node=2 --cpus-per-task=20 --constraint=clx --mem=0 \
       parallel-manipulator -v manipulate-connectome wiring_config.json \
       --output-dir PATH_TO_OUTPUT --profile --convert-to-sonata --splits=100

Please note that this feature will require at least 4 MPI ranks. Dask will use 2 ranks to manage the distributed cluster. We recommend to use a high number for ``--cpus-per-task`` to create Dask workers that will be able to process a lot of data in parallel.

When processing with ``parallel-manipulator``, one may pass the flag ``--target-payload`` to determine how big the individual workload for each process should be. The default value of 20e9 was determined empirically to run on the whole mouse brain with 75 million neurons. We recommend to use this value as a starting point and scale it up or down to achieve the desired runtime characteristics.

❗ Notes on error handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Errors may occur for many different reasons and are not always easy to track. Most common errors are that an allocation gets "killed", either due to a time limit or due to an out-of-memory error. Here we provide a few hints on how to avoid or track errors that may occur:

-  Use the "verbose" mode (``-v`` flag) which will produce a lot of log output.
-  Look into the log files: there is usually one master log file and individual log files for all data splits, all of which can be found in the ``/logs`` subfolder of the output circuit folder.
-  Use a small connectome to start with.
-  Use a simple operation to start with, such as ``null_manipulation`` (see examples).
-  Run serially to start with, before switching to parallel processing.
-  Start with a single data split.
-  But: In case of memory errors, use more than a single data splits, even when running serially (!), which will reduce the memory consumption as individual splits will be processed one after the other.
-  When running in parallel, use ``--tasks-per-node`` in the SLURM configuration to define how many tasks (=splits) will be executed on a single node; reducing this number may reduce the risk of out-of-memory errors.
-  In general: Increasing memory allocation and/or allocation time may help.
-  For high performance: Allocate many nodes and use parallel processing together with a relatively large number of data splits depending on the network size (i.e., aim for a few hundered post-synaptic neurons per data split).
