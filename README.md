## Introduction

An important way to study cortical function _in silico_ lies in manipulations that are impossible to perform _in vivo_ and _in vitro_. The purpose of the _Connectome-Manipulator_ is to provide a general framework to apply and study various types of structural manipulations of a circuit connectome. The framework allows for rapid connectome manipulations of biophysically detailed network models in [SONATA](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/sonata/blob/master/docs/SONATA_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) format, the standard for large-scale network models. Manipulations can be targeted to entire models, specific sub-networks, or even single neurons, ranging from insertion or removal of specific motifs to complete rewiring based on stochastic connectivity models at various levels of complexity.
Important use cases include wiring a connectome from scratch in a biologically realistic way based on given features of connectivity, rewiring an existing connectome while preserving certain aspects of connectivity, and transplanting specific connectivity characteristics from one connectome to another. The resulting connectomes can be readily simulated using any simulator supporting SONATA, allowing systematic and reproducible characterization of causal effects of manipulations on network activity.


## Install

~~~
git clone https://github.com/BlueBrain/connectome-manipulator.git
cd connectome-manipulator
pip install .
~~~

All dependencies declared in `setup.py` and are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), including one optional dependency, `mpi4py` (v3.1.4), which is required for parallel processing, i.e., to run `parallel-manipulator`. Another optional dependency, `parquet-converters` (v0.8.0 or higher), required for converting .parquet output files to SONATA must be installed separately, see instructions under https://github.com/BlueBrain/parquet-converters.

Recommended Python version: v3.10.8

## Framework overview

### Main components

The _Connectome-Manipulator_ framework is illustrated in Figure 1 and consists of the following main components: 

* __Connectome manipulator__\
  As specified in the config, applies one or a sequence of manipulations to a given SONATA connectome, and writes the manipulated connectome to a new SONATA edges file. All manipulations are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.\
  Details can be found in the corresponding README file: [/connectome_manipulation/README.md](connectome_manipulator/connectome_manipulation/)
* __Model building__\
  As specified in the config, builds a model from a given connectome and writes the model to a file to be loaded and used by specific manipulations requiring a model (e.g., model-based rewiring based on connection probability model). All models are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.\
  Details can be found in the corresponding README file: [/model_building/README.md](connectome_manipulator/model_building/)
  
  > <u>Notes</u>:
  > - Some models may not even require a connectome as input.
  > - Some models may depend on other models as input for model building.

* __Structural comparator__\
  As specified in the config, performs a structural comparison of the original and manipulated connectomes. Different structural parameters to compare (connection probability, synapses per connection, ...) are separately implemented in sub-modules and can be easily extended.\
  Details can be found in the corresponding README file: [/connectome_comparison/README.md](connectome_manipulator/connectome_comparison/)

### Operation principle of the "connectome manipulator"

As illustrated in Figure 2, the synapses of the connectome (SONATA edges) are divided into k splits targeting disjoint sets of N post-synaptic neurons (SONATA nodes), which reduces the memory consumption and facilitates parallelization on multiple computation nodes. Each split is an edge table loaded as Pandas dataframe and comprising a list of synapses together with all synapse properties, an example is shown in Figure 3. The manipulations are then applied separately to each edge table in sequence (or alternatively, in parallel), resulting in manipulated edge tables which are then written to separate .parquet files. In the end, all .parquet files are merged into one manipulated SONATA connectome file using `parquet-converters`.

> <u>Notes</u>:
> - Manipulations can only be applied to a single SONATA edges population at a time.
> - The synapses in each loaded edge table are assumed to be sorted by post-synaptic neuron ID. Likewise, the manipulated edges tables are to be returned with synapses sorted by post-synaptic neuron ID.
> - Optionally, processing can be resumed from an earlier (incomplete) run, by re-using all .parquet files that already exist instead of re-computing them.
> - By default, all .parquet files will be deleted after successfull completion, i.e., after the manipulated SONATA connectome file has been generated. Optionally, these temporary .parquet files can be kept as well.

~~~

Just running serially you can do something like this:

```
connectome-manipulator -v manipulate-connectome wiring_config.json \
    --output-dir PATH_TO_OUTPUT --profile --convert-to-sonata --splits 1
```

Running splits in parallel (with Dask) you can use the `parallel-manipulator` executable that will set up Dask automatically (and switch the `--parallel` flag by default to `True`, too):

```
srun --nodes 10 --tasks-per-node=2 --cpus-per-task=20 --constraint=clx --mem=0 \
    parallel-manipulator -v manipulate-connectome wiring_config.json \
    --output-dir PATH_TO_OUTPUT --profile --convert-to-sonata --splits=100
```

Please note that this feature will require at least 4 MPI ranks. Dask will use 2 ranks to manage the distributed cluster. We recommend to use a high number for `--cpus-per-task` to create Dask workers that will be able to process a lot of data in parallel.

When processing with `parallel-manipulator`, one may pass the flag `--target-payload` to determine how big the individual workload for each process should be. The default value of 20e9 was determined empirically to run on the whole mouse brain with 75 million neurons. We recommend to use this value as a starting point and scale it up or down to achieve the desired runtime characteristics.
